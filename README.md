# horses-or-human-classifier
Training a model using Tensorflow on the Horses or Humans dataset. This contains over a thousand images of horses and humans with varying poses and filesizes. Then upload an image of either horse or human into the 'images' file to check if the model classifies it as horse or human.

USE !wget https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow-1-public/course2/week3/horse-or-human.zip or Download the zip file from the link https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow-1-public/course2/week3/horse-or-human.zip and unzip the file to get the horse or human dataset.
Create another file called 'images' and then add your preferred image which the model has never seen so that it can be classified by the model based on it's training.
